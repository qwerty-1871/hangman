# Python Hangman
## Introduction
Hello! I created this as part of a school project where I learned about Python. This is the first program I have created independently in Python. I would appreciate any feedback.
## Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python installed. You can get it for your operating system from https://www.python.org/downloads/  
Press "Releases" on the right side of the screen. The most recent release will be at the top of the screen. Press "Assets" then "hangman-version.tar.gz" and download it. 
## Running the program
How you run the program will depend on your operating system:  
On Windows, you should be able to double click on the program(hangman.py) like any other and it will open in a terminal windows  
On Linux, navigate to the program's folder with your file browser. Right click and click "Open in Terminal", then run 'python hangman.py'  
On MacOS, right click on the program(hangman.py) and select Open With then Python Launcher  
Enjoy!
